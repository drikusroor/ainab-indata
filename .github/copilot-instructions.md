## Ticket Completion Commit Policy

When working on a GitHub ticket (issue or pull request) with a ticket number,
and you believe you have finished the task, you must always propose to commit
the relevant changes with a clear, descriptive commit message that includes:
"Closes #{ticketNumber}" (where ticketNumber is the number of the ticket).
This ensures the ticket is automatically closed when the commit is pushed.

### Example

If you finish work for ticket #42, your commit message should include: "Closes #42"
